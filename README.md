# Weather-Dashboard

*****NOTE: I had to reupload to a new repo for this assignment like assignment 4, for whatever reason it would not take my last update to my javascript page which was fixing my deployment issue. the original link is https://dhruza88.github.io/WeatherDashboard if needed to check on more commits*****

In this assignment we were tasked with learning how to fully link a 3rd party API, and be able to pull data from object attributes and place them in the proper location on the HTML page.

This further built upon alot of the techniques used in homework assignment 4 the code quiz, the scenario in which you saved local storage and displayed on page which extremely similiar, just changing certain commands to display it differently rather than a high score.

The unique part of this assignment was having to use 2 api's to get your result, as the one API  gave you all the pertain weather Data was reliant on latitude and longitude coordinates. Without the help of the second API i would never have been able to input the correct data to gather the 7 day forecast.

As similiar to the code quiz i relied on JSON to parse out the array to display my saved storage. That way when you clicked on the city name it was able to have all the attributes stored and place back onto the proper location.

Making sure that the index was located on the proper object was also a learning experience as since this page was created mostly from dynamic javascript it wasn't as simple as just looking for the label setup in html.

This was a fun experience learning how much data can come from an API. How you can power a good portion of a website driven just by various API's available on the internet.
